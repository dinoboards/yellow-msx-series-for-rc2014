# Yellow MSX Series for RC2014

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/vipoo/yellow-msx-series-for-rc2014/tree/dev.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/vipoo/yellow-msx-series-for-rc2014/tree/dev)

Hackaday Project: [msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014](https://hackaday.io/project/175574-msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014)


</br>

The repo describes a series of boards designed to be compatible with the RC2014 bus.  Once the minimum set of boards are assembled, you will have your very own MSX+ compatible computer -- built by you!

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX/MSX2+ games!

The story of the prototyping and development these boards can be found at the Hackaday Project: [msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014](https://hackaday.io/project/175574-msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014) project page.

#### Integrating the ESP8266 Wifi Module

Click [here](./wifi/README.md) for instructions on integrating the stock RC2014 ESP8266 wifi module into your MSX build.

Kits are available from the official RC2014 stores at [z80Kits](https://z80kits.com/shop/esp8266-wifi-module) and [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/semachthemonkey/esp8266-wifi-module-for-rc2014/)



## Cloning this repo

This repo contains submodules.  So to clone the repo's submodules, you may need to do the following:

`git clone --recursive git@github.com:vipoo/yellow-msx-series-for-rc2014.git`

If you had already cloned it, without the `--recursive` switch:

`git submodule update --init`

> If using Windows Subsystem for Linux, make sure you are using the linux file system (not the mnt/c/... ntfs images)

**Please note: github submodule configuration assumes you are using ssh to access the repos**

If you get a permission denied error when attempting to clone the submodules, it may be due to your github access method.  The submodules are referenced using git ssh paths (eg:  git@github.com:vipoo/Nextor.git), as such if you attempt to clone these submodules using only https access, you may get a permission denied error.

To setup github access using ssl - follow the instruction on github at: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

### Force use of https://... git paths

Alternatively, if you wish to clone using the https path, you may find running this command first before cloning the submodule will help:

```
git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
```
