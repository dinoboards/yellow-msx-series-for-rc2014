My thanks to PCBWay for helping out - https://hackaday.io/project/175574-msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014/log/205923-sponsorship-from-pcbway

</br>

The repo describes a series of boards designed for RC2014, to give MSX+ compatiblity.

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX/MSX2+ games!

The story of the prototyping and development these boards can be found at the Hackaday Project: [msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014](https://hackaday.io/project/175574-msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014) project page.

## Other Board ideas

* Incorporate existing RC2014 boards, such as Floppy, IDE, Flash storage, Serial etc into a MSX system.
* Cassette Interface
* Others....

## Cloning this repo

This repo contains submodules.  So to clone the repo's submodules, you may need to do the following:

`git clone --recursive git@github.com:vipoo/yellow-msx-series-for-rc2014.git`

If you had already cloned it, without the `--recursive` switch:

`git submodule update --init`

> If using Windows Subsystem for Linux, make sure you are using the linux file system (not the mnt/c/... ntfs images)

**Please note: github submodule configuration assumes you are using ssh to access the repos**

If you get a permission denied error when attempting to clone the submodules, it may be due to your github access method.  The submodules are referenced using git ssh paths (eg:  git@github.com:vipoo/Nextor.git), as such if you attempt to clone these submodules using only https access, you may get a permission denied error.

To setup github access using ssl - follow the instruction on github at: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
