## Title

V9958 Video Board designed for RC2014 systems.

## Brief Description

A Yellow MSX Series board that gives your RC2014 advanced 80's graphics.  Its based around the V9958 chip that was used
in the MSX2+ series of computers from the late 80s.

## Full Description

This board gives your RC2014 the graphics capabilities of the late 80s. Its based on the V9958 Video Display Processor (VDP) which powered
the MSX2+ series of 8 bit computers.

This V9958 chip, was produced by Yamaha in the late 80s and was an update to the their V9938 chip, which was itself, a successor to TI's TMS9918 VDP.  This V9938/V9958 addressed many of the short comings of the original TMS9918.

### Some of the V9958 key features include:

* hardware acceleration (line and dot commands, horizontal scrolling registers, and others)
* Support for up to 19268 colours
* 13 Screen Modes
* resolutions up to 512 x 212

The V9938 was included in the MSX2 line of computers, with the V9958 used in the MSX2+ and TurboR machines.


### What is the 'Yellow MSX Series of Boards'?

These are a series of boards that I am developing to give the RC2014 true MSX compliance.  Some of the key boards intend to be compatible with standard RC2014 builds running under RomWBW.

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX/MSX2+ games!

The V9958 board here is the first in that series.

### Key features of this board

* Compatible with RC2014 and RomWBW
* 128K of RAM
* RGB, Composite and S-Video output
* Can be built for PAL or NTSC

### What's included in this kit

The full kits includes everything you need for the board (PCB, passive components, crystals, sockets, connectors and ICs including V9958 and 4x41464C ram)

(The specific components for both PAL and NTSC are included).

### What else do I need to make this work?

* You need a working RC2014 system (cpu, RomWBW, Clock, etc).
* A solution to display Composite, S-VIDEO or RGBS signals.  For a modern monitor you will almost certainly need a converter of some kind.
* For RGB output (recommended for best quality), you may need to make a cable to connect to your preferred display.

### Disclaimer

Please note that this is a kit, produced by a non-professional (me) for hackers, DIYers' and retro lovers to tinker with.  I have conducted the following tests for this board:
1. RGB PAL and NTSC connected to a [OSSC](https://www.retrorgb.com/ossc.html) (to a HDMI monitor).
2. NTSC Composite and S-VIDEO output connected to a cheap ebay VGA converter (colours and quality output ok but not brilliant).
