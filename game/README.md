# YM2149 GAME Board Designed for RC2014

Hackaday Project: [msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014](https://hackaday.io/project/175574-msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014)

The repo describes the YM2149 sound and controller board designed for RC2014 systems.  It is part of planned series of boards, to provide full MSX2+ compliance.

Highlights:
* YM2149 PSG - 3 channel audio, +1 noise channel
* 2 Controller Inputs (joystick, game-pad, and other input types) - MSX compatible
* optional additional audio input lines, for mixing into the audio out.

## Sample Apps

The tune.com cp/m distributed with RomWBW works just find with the board - as it has the standard MSX ports.

For a standard RC2014 (RomWBW, cp/m) - the only code I have that utilises the sound and controller is the chip8 intpreter - with an appropriate configuration file to map the controller inputs to one of the hex keypad inputs of a chip8 game.

## Port Mapping

Standard MSX port mapping.

| Port |  range	| Description
|:------:|-------|-------------|
| #A0  | (write)| Register write port
| #A1  | (write)|	Value write port
| #A2  | (read)	| Value read port

The following table describes the registers of the PSG:

| Register(s)	| Description |
|:------:|-------|
| 0-5	| Tone generator control |
| 6	| Noise generator control |
| 7	| Mixer control-I/O enable. Important note: bit 6 must be 0, and bit 7 must be 1.  |
| 8-10	| Amplitude control |
| 11-13	| Envelope generator control |
| 14-15	| I/O ports A & B |
