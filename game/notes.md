Title: YM2149 MSX Compatible Sound/Controller board for RC2014

Descr: Give your RC2014 MSX sound and controller inputs capability.

### What is it?

This kit provides another step in getting your RC2014 MSX compatible.  With this board your RC2014 can
play chiptunes, receive input from MSX compatible game pads/joysticks.

Its based around the YM2149 chip which was include in many MSX/MSX2 systems.  The chip is very similar
and generally compatible with the AY-3-8910.  Although this board is designed for the YM2149 to keep things simple.

As per the [msx.org wiki](https://www.msx.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2149)

"The main difference between the YM2149 and AY-3-8910 is that the internal volume control of the D/A converter has 32 levels instead of 16, so the hardware envelope is more smooth"

### Key features?
* YM2149 PSG - 3 channel audio, +1 noise channel
* 2 Controller Inputs (joystick, game-pad, and other input types) - MSX compatible
* optional additional audio input lines, for mixing into the audio out

### What is the 'Yellow MSX Series of Boards'?

These are a series of boards that I am developing to achieve MSX compatibility for RC2014 systems.

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX/MSX2+ games!

The first board in the series is the [V9958 Video board](https://www.tindie.com/products/dinotron/v9958-msx-video-board-for-rc2014/)

The Game board is the second in that series.

### What's included in this kit

The full kits includes everything you need (PCB, passive components, crystals, sockets, DE9 connector for MSX compatible devices and ICs including the YM2149 chip)

### What else do I need to make this work?

* You need a working RC2014 system (cpu, RomWBW, Clock, etc - enhanced bus required).
* For audio output, an external powered speaker to plug into the standard 3.5 socket
* For controller, a MSX compatible controller
