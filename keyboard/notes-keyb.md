### Using the keyboard on RomWBW

Although this kit is designed to work under MSX's software, it can be used in a stock RC2014 a correctly configured RomWBW build.

### What is the 'Yellow MSX Series of Boards'?

These are a series of boards developed to achieve MSX+ compatibility.

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX/MSX2+ games!

The first board in the series was the [V99x8 Video board](https://www.tindie.com/products/dinotron/v99x8-msx-rgb-video-module-for-rc2014)
