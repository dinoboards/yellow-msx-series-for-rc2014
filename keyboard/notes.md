Title: Full Size, 73 keys, keyboard designed for RC2014

Descr: Give your RC2014 a full size proper keyboard

### What is it?

A full size keyboard kit for your RC2014 system, incorporating 5 pin Cherry compatible switches, for that perfect clicky keyboard.

With diodes associated with every switch, it possible to identify all multi key press combinations - no ghost key presses.

### Key features

* Unambiguous key detection (diodes associated with every switch)
* Power, caps-lock, and code indicator LEDs
* Cherry 5 pin switches
* 73 keys

### Using keyboard on RomWBW

Although this kit is designed to work under MSX's software, it can be used in a stock RC2014 build for keyboard.

As the 82C55 is a general purpose interface chip, you could, within the constraints of the schematic, customise many of the control lines.

### What is the 'Yellow MSX Series of Boards'?

These are a series of boards that I am developing to achieve MSX compatibility for RC2014 systems.

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX/MSX2+ games!

The first board in the series is the [V9958 Video board](https://www.tindie.com/products/dinotron/v9958-msx-video-board-for-rc2014/)

### What's included in this kit

This project includes both the keyboard kit and the PPI interface board kit.

* Keyboard PCB and components (passive components, IDC socket, and ICs)
* PPI PCB and components (passive components, IDC socket, and ICs including the 82C55 chip)
* Optional Gateron switches, stabilisers and keycaps

### What else do I need to make this work?

* You need a working RC2014 system (CPU, RomWBW, Clock, etc).
* Enhanced Bus backplane required.

### Disclaimer

Please note that this is a kit, produced by a non-professional (me) for hackers, DIYers' and retro lovers, to tinker with.  I will do my best to answer any support questions you may have.
