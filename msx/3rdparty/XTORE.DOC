                      We use following denotations  in  this
                      document:  angle  brackets  <  and   >
                      enclose  special  keys;   consequently
                      pressed keys are  separated  by  blank
                      while simultaneously pressed ones - by
                      plus.


     TOR is a screen text editor. It runs on MSX2 or MSX per-
sonal computers with  VDP 9938  under the  operating  system
MSX-DOS.

     Getting started:
      A> XTor[/V][/d[nnn]][/S[macro]][/Xpassword] [files...]

     Flag /V allows to expand text buffer by whole equipped
Video RAM except the lowest 16K (for VRAM 128K total buffer
size 136K, for VRAM 64K - 72K). NOTE:  DON'T  use  flag  /V
when RAM-disk installed, because RAM-disk usually  involves
all equipped VRAM.
     Flag /d[nnn] allows  to  use  file  XTOR.$$$,  created
authomatically on the drive d:  (file size  nnn+4 K  bytes,
total buffer size nnn+24 K; if nnn is absent  or  if  there
are no sufficient  space  on  the  disk,  editor  allocates
maximum available  space  to  the  file  XTOR.$$$).  It  is
recomended to use RAM-disk. Once you use floppy  disk,  any
permanent  I/O  error   in   buffer   file   causes   fatal
IMPOSSIBILITY to continue edition;  you  cannot  even  save
modified text. Error message and request to insert diskette
for drive d: are placed at  the  top  left  corner  of  the
screen.
     Flag /S allows to load authomatically macrodefinitions,
stored previously to file 'macro' or 'TOR.TOR' (if /S  only
present).
     Flag /Xpassword defines password for loading and saving
texts.

     Samples:
      A> XTor/V *.DOC B:*.TXT
            The  most  common  configuration  allows  total
            buffer size 136K for VRAM 128K MSX2.
      á> XTor/B200
            Text buffer uses 200K on drive B:.

     Features and functions:
- type in, save and edit texts  with arbitrary  line lengths
  and all possible symbols (including graphs and controls);
- edit  1 to 10 texts  simultaneously  (each text  is loaded
  into separate text buffer);  sum of text sizes  is limited
  by available memory size;
- use variety of editing means:  move  cursor  by character/
  word/line/page, delete character/word/line, yank character
  string and paste it at any point, slice and join the lines,
  and others;
- involve  simplest text formatting  (paragraphs  with equal
  right edge, centrified titles)  when  you type in new text
  and when text is already present; 
- search character target and context replace  (confirmed or
  no);
- establish two text windows, each of which bound to separa-
  te part of one or different buffers (texts);
- fix up the group of lines and then delete, copy or move it
  inside one buffer  or from one buffer to another  (you may
  copy or move contents of background window as well);
- edit in 40- or 80-character mode,  independently from ope-
  rating system (BIOS) mode;
- load additional files into buffers (entirely or partly);
- save  the text  from each buffer  (entirely or partly)  to
  disk either as new file, or appending to existing;
- look through (type)  any files,  print them or contents of
  text buffers;
- define, use and modify 10 editing macros;
- set current date and time (if Clock-chip is present);
- adjust foreground and background colors of text and of me-
  ssage and information lines;
- obtain brief instant help (<ctrl>+?).


        1. Text Editing

     You may type symbols in insert or replace mode.  Insert
mode is turned on initially.  To  turn  insert  mode  on/off
press <ins> key.

     The cursor in replace mode is represented by high rect-
angle, while in insert mode - by low one.  Inside the physi-
cal text line rectangle is filled, while outside it - empty.
Once  you key in  new symbols  outside the line,  additional
blanks are inserted authomatically.

     You use  both special keys  (arrows,  carriage  return,
etc.)  and  control keys (with <ctrl> key pressed)  to edit.
Usual key layout  is not supported:  for instance,  all keys
further are different editor  controls:<ret>,  <ctrl>+<ret>,
<ctrl>+M  É  <shift>+<ctrl>+M.  You  may  use   <ctrl>+<esc>
instead of <shift>+<ctrl>.


        1.1. Control Keys for Cursor Movements

<left>,
<right>          - move cursor one character left/reght.
<ctrl>+<left>,
<ctrl>+<right>   - move cursor one word left/reght.
<shift>+<ctrl>+<left>,
<shift>+<ctrl>+<right>
                 - scroll left/right  (move cursor moves one
                   character  left/right,  while  the window
                   rolls in opposite direction;  thus cursor
                   preserves its screen position).
<up>,
<down>           - move cursor one line up/down.
<ctrl>+<up>,
<ctrl>+<down>    - move cursor one page up/down  (page  size
                   is the size of current window).
<shift>+<ctrl>+<up>,
<shift>+<ctrl>+<down>
                 - scroll up/down; cursor moves one line up/
                   down,  while the window rolls in opposite
                   direction;   thus  cursor  preserves  its
                   screen position.

<ret>            - line feed (independent from insert mode).

<ctrl>+<tab>     - tab step right (text does not change).
<shift>+<ctrl>+<tab>
                 - tab step left (text does not change).

<ctrl>+M         - locate line with desired number.
<shift>+<ctrl>+M - locate top line  of the block  (marked by
                   <ctrl>+B).
<ctrl>+V         - locate first line of the text.
<shift>+<ctrl>+V - locate last line of the text.

<ctrl>+F         - locate physical end of line.
<shift>+<ctrl>+F - locate the beginning of line.

<shift>+<ctrl>+U - store current cursor position.
<ctrl>+U         - retrieve  stored  cursor position  (store
                   current position in turn; you may restore
                   it by pressing <ctrl>+U again).


        1.2. Control Keys for Screen Editing

<ret>            - line feed (independent from insert mode).
<ctrl>+<ret>     - slice line  and  line  feed  (independent
                   from insert mode as well).

<ins>            - turn insert mode on/off.
<ctrl>+<blank>   - insert blank (cursor remains in place).

<tab>            - store tab symbol (tab step you may adjust
                   by <ctrl>+| key).
<stop>           - store next control symbol rather than exe-
                   cute   (for  instance,  <stop> <ret>   or
                   <stop> <ctrl>+M   would   store   control
                   character with 0D code).
<ctrl>+=         - store character with desired code.

<ctrl>+[         - convert letters to lower case.
<shift>+<ctrl>+[ - convert letters to upper case.
<ctrl>+]         - convert Russian letters to Latin.
<shift>+<ctrl>+] - convert Latin letters to Russian.

<del>            - delete character right.
<ctrl>+<del>     - delete word after right.
<bs>             - delete character left.
<ctrl>+<bs>      - delete word left.

<ctrl>+E         - erase characters right to the end of line.
<shift>+<ctrl>+E - erase characters left  from the beginning
                   of line.

<ctrl>+<ins>     - insert empty line.
<ctrl>+K         - delete line.
<ctrl>+N         - slice line.
<ctrl>+J         - join lines.

<ctrl>+Y         - yank character string, starting from cur-
                   sor position  (to yank  all symbols  upto
                   end of line,  just press <ret>; otherwise
                   adjust yanked string by cursor keys  and/
                   or edit keys and then press <ret>).
<ctrl>+P         - paste character string of <ctrl>+Y.

<ctrl>+C         - reset line:  if line was deleted,  it re-
                   turns into text;  if it  was altered, its
                   initial contents  is included  before it.
                   Press <ctrl>+C once more  to delete reset
                   line. Note, that line resets properly, if
                   it is not longer than 511 characters.


        1.3. Control Keys for Text Formatting

<ctrl>+L         - format paragraph  (consisting of the cur-
                   rent line and consequent ones having left
                   offset being not equal to the left offset
                   of current line).
<shift>+<ctrl>+L - format  group  of  lines  (between  lines
                   <ctrl>+B  to  <shift>+<ctrl>+B paragraphs
                   are selected and formatted).

<shift>+<ctrl>+Z - centrify title.

<ctrl>+I         - turn authomatical input formatting on/off.
                   If 80-character mode is set,  bottom line
                   of the screen displays whether authomati-
                   cal formatting is turned on.
<shift>+<ctrl>+I - set formatting parameters: left and right
                   edge positions,  left offset for the beg-
                   inning of paragraph.  You may alter para-
                   meters  using formatting line in  80-cha-
                   racter mode.  To alter parameter,  marked
                   by cursor, use arrows;  to skip  from one
                   parameter  to another use  <ctrl>+arrows;
                   to turn  automatical  hyphenation  on/off
                   use "minus" key.
<ctrl>+<         - set left edge by cursor position.
<ctrl>+>         - set right edge by cursor position.
<ctrl>+\         - set paragraph offset by cursor position.
<ctrl>+-         - turn automatical hyphenation on/off.

     When authomatical input formatting is turned on:
- once  you type in  to the right  from  current  right edge
  position, extra characters are transferred to the new line
  (line is transferred at blank position  or  by word hyphe-
  nation; right edge is authomatically equalized).
- once you type in  carriage return <ret>, current paragraph
  terminates,  i.e. current line is not equalized and cursor
  locates left offset position of the next line.


        1.4. Control Keys for Search and Replace

<ctrl>+S         - ask target and search forward.
<ctrl>+T         - ask target and search backwards.
<ctrl>+Q         - continue search.

<ctrl>+X         - ask target, replacement and confirm mode,
                   execute context replace.

<shift>+<ctrl>+S,
<shift>+<ctrl>+T,
<shift>+<ctrl>+Q,
<shift>+<ctrl>+X - same as previous, but the target is reco-
                   gnised  at the beginning of the word only.

     If you want to "expand"  action onto all buffers,  just
press the same key once more.

     Enter target (and replacement), then press <ret>.

     When you type in target  or  replace,  you  may  key in
<ctrl>+? ("arbitrary character"). It conforms to any charac-
ter during the search  and preserves target character during
replace.

     You  may  key  in  end-of-line  indicator  by  pressing
<ctrl>+<ret>.

     You may also key in <ctrl>+P  to paste yanked character
string (see <ctrl>+Y) to target or replace.

     Once search or context replace passes through the first
(last) line of the text, the message appears at message line.

     To interrupt search or replace, press <ctrl>+<stop>.


        1.5. Control Keys for Groups of Lines

<ctrl>+B         - mark the top line of the group.
<shift>+<ctrl>+B - mark the bottom line of the group.
                   While screen is in 80-character mode, li-
                   nes of group are marked by color.

<shift>+<ctrl>+M - locate top line  of the block  (marked by
                   <ctrl>+B).

<ctrl>+G         - copy group of lines (top and bottom lines
                   are marked by <ctrl>+B,<shift>+<ctrl>+B).
                   Current line may lay inside copied group.
<shift>+<ctrl>+G - copy the lines of background window (same
                   as <ctrl>+G,  but  the group of lines  is
                   set to the window).

<ctrl>+H         - move group of lines (same as <ctrl>+G,but
                   group of lines is deleted at former place
                   when copied).
<shift>+<ctrl>+H - move the lines of background window (same
                   as <ctrl>+H,  but  the group of lines  is
                   set to the window).

<shift>+<ctrl>+K - delete group of lines if confirmed.


        2. Text Buffers

     Each text  is loaded into  one of  10 buffers  numbered
0 to 9. Buffer control keys are listed below.

<ctrl>+U         - change current buffer to desired.

<ctrl>+R         - change current buffer  to next  (increase
                   buffer number).

<shift>+<ctrl>+R - change current buffer  to  previous  (de-
                   crease buffer number).

<ctrl>+D         - get information on all buffers; each buf-
                   fer message displays current line number,
                   last line number,  current  position  and
                   the default  file name;  first  and  last
                   lines of the group are displayed with ap-
                   propriate buffer.
                   To enter some buffer, press corresponding
                   key 0-9.


        3. Windows

     There are  two text windows  with information lines and
message line  on the screen.  Window control keys are listed
below.

     Cursor locates  at one  of the windows;  it  is  called
"foreground", while the other one - "background".

     Information line of each window displayes buffer, defa-
ult file name, current and last line numbers, current positi-
on  and  the number of first line in the window. Information
line of foreground window displayes  also the size of unused
buffers' memory, code character, pointed out by cursor,  and
buffer, first and last lines of the group, if any.

     Message line displayes current date and,  if Clock-chip
presents, current time. All messages and requests are placed
at this line.

     Information lines and message line are enhanced  by co-
lor in 80-character mode.  You may adjust all colors (chara-
cters and background of text and lines).  The default values
of the colors are taken from COLOR statement (the first  and
the second ones  determine colors for text,  the third - the
color of information and message lines).

     If one of the windows contains no lines, its informati-
on line is not displayed. Once editor gets started,  its up-
per window does contain no lines and thus is not displayed.

<ctrl>+O         - move window boundary up.
<ctrl>+<shift>+O - move window boundary down.

<ctrl>+A         - skip to background window.

<ctrl>+W         - centrify current window (window moves  so
                   that cursor position is as near to window
                   center as possible).

<ctrl>+A         - conform  windows  (set  the first line of
                   background  window  to the first  line of
                   foreground window).

<home>           - locate first line of the window.
<cls> (i.e.<ctrl>+<home>)
                 - locate last line of the window.

<shift>+<ctrl>+G - copy the lines of background window (same
                   as <ctrl>+G,  but  the group of lines  is
                   set to the window).

<shift>+<ctrl>+H - move the lines of background window (same
                   as <ctrl>+H,  but  the group of lines  is
                   set to the window).


        3. Settings

<esc>            - enter files mode.

<select>         - switch 40- or 80-character mode.

<ctrl>+<stop>    - turn control characters blinknig on/off.

<ctrl>+|         - change tab step to required value; initial
                   value is 8.

<ctrl>+*         - change  date,  time  and  colors;  choose
                   field by left and right arrows, change va-
                   lue by up and down arrows.


        5. Macros

     Key sequence  may form the macro.  There are  10 macros
numbered 0 to 9.

     To define macro you press <shift>+<ctrl>+digit, then key
in all edit actions, and then press <ctrl>+@. The process  of
execution is displayed at the screen,  as  usually,  but  all
keys are  also  stored  as  macrodefinition.  The  number  of
actions in macrodefinition cannot be more than 64.

     <ctrl>+@ not only terminates macrodefinition,  but  also
displayes the definitions of all macros. Once all  macrodefi-
nitions are displayed, you may key in any digit 0-9 and  edit
the corresponding macrodefinition. Use the same keys  as  for
target string after <ctrl>+S. To store some control key press
<stop> before it.

     To execute macro you press  <ctrl>+digit,  and all keys
of macrodefinition are executed in turn,  as if you key them
in now again.

     You may save macrodefinitions to disk and load them la-
ter.


        6. Files

     Once you press <esc> key,  you get command menu of file
mode:
      L - Load file into current buffer
<esc> L - Load files  into empty buffers  (this command  is
          involved authomatically when editor starts)
      S - Save text from current buffer to file
<esc> S - Save all modified texts to file
      A - Append  text  from current buffer  to their default
           files

      T - Type file(s) onto screen
      P - Print file(s) or buffer(s)

      D - Look through disk directory
      K - Delete file(s)
      R - Rename file(s)
      N - Alter default file name of current buffer

      X - Set password for loading and saving texts

      I - Load macrodefinitions
      J - Save macrodefinitions

      C - Clear current buffer
<esc> C - Clear all buffers
      Q - Quit the editor

     Each cammand proposes  some default specification  (file
name or wild card). You may accept it (press <ret>) or  type
in any file name, wild card or several names.

     Once you load text into empty buffer,  its file name  is
stored as default one.  This name is always proposed  as  de-
fault when you save text (S, <esc> S, C, <esc> C, Q). The de-
fault file name may be altered by S or N commands only,  and
erased by C or <esc> C commands.

     The initial default names for all buffers are taken from
start command of editor. All files are loaded into consequent
buffers during  the initialisation.  You may  type  in 0 to 9
file names.

     C and <esc> C commands  cancel  default name,  and after
that file name from the first L command  becomes new default.
The default name may be altered by N command. It also changes
when you save whole text to some file.

     Q, C  and  <esc> C  commands  before  appropriate action
first check up,  if loaded texts  were modified.  If so,  you
must answer, whether you want to save text or no.

     <esc> L, <esc> S, <esc> C, Q, T, P, K and R commands may
ask confirmation for any file or text. You may answer Y(yes),
N(no), G(go). To interrupt processing press <ctrl>+<stop>.

     Once T or P command is executed,  you may interrupt type
or print process, pressing <ctrl>+<stop>.  To force temporary
pause, just press any other key  (press any key  once more to
continue execution).

     Texts being loaded and saved may be coded  by  password.
