* Purpose

  TestRAM is an utility for testing
all memory devices of your MSX, byte
by byte, and report you if any error
was found.

* Using

  - MSX-DOS EXECUTABLE

  Execute TestRAM by typing at the
MSX-DOS (1 or 2) prompt:

  TESTRAM

  - ROM FILE

  Burn an EPROM with the 16K code and
simply boot your MSX with the EPROM cart
inserted.

  - USING IT

  TestRAM is capable of testing three
memory devices: RAM (base/mapper),
VRAM and MegaRAM.
  After executed, TestRAM will identify
these three devices in your MSX and
will show you the resulting.
  Using the cursor keys and the space
bar you can select a device to test or
test all devices. The options are:

  Test MSX base RAM
  Test MSX Video RAM
  Test MSX Memory Mapper
  Test MSX MegaRAM
  Do all test above
  Restart program
  Reset program

* Registering the program

  TestRAM is not free. TestRAM is
"programware". What does it means? It
means that if you like TestRAM and
use it, you must register it by sending
me a MSX program (freeware or 
shareware). It can be any program,
including one made by yourself (but,
please, not a BASIC "Hello world!").
  By doing it you will receive the last
version of TestRAM and will have all
the support on it.
