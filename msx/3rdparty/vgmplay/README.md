VGMPlay can play back music for quite a number of sound chips using various
common and less common sound expansions for MSX, such as the PSG, MoonSound and
Yamaha SFG. A detailed list can be found below.

Both the VGM and VGZ formats are supported. The compressed VGZ format takes
longer to load but also consumes less disk space. If so desired, VGZ files can
be manually decompressed to VGM with
[gunzip for MSX](http://www.grauw.nl/projects/gunzip/) or PC.

The timing resolution is 50 or 60 Hz on MSX1 machines with a TMS9918 VDP, 300 Hz
on machines with a V9938 or V9958 VDP, 1130 Hz if a MoonSound or OPL3 is
present, and 4000 Hz on MSX turboR.

Usage instructions
------------------

Run VGMPlay from MSX-DOS 2, specifying the VGM file to play on the command line.

Usage:

    vgmplay [options] <file.vgm>

The compressed VGZ format is also supported.

Options:

  * `/l` Number of playback loops. Default: 2.
    
    Many VGM music loops once the end of the song is reached. With this setting
    you can specify how many times VGMPlay should play the repeating part before
    exiting. The amount is specified like `/L15`. Use `/L` or `/L0` to loop
    infinitely. This setting will have no effect for songs which donâ€™t loop.
    
  * `/b` Enter blackout mode during playback.
    
    This setting makes the screen go black during playback. For machines with a
    lot of VDP interference on the audio output, this may reduce the amount of
    interference.

To configure Multi Mente to play VGM files, add the following lines to
MMRET.DAT:

    .VGM    VGMPLAY $T
    .VGZ    VGMPLAY $T


Development information
-----------------------

VGMPlay is free and open source software. If you want to contribute to the
project you are very welcome to. Please contact me at any one of the places
mentioned in the project information section.

You are also free to re-use code for your own projects, provided you abide by
the license terms.

VGMPlay depends on the library projects Neonlib and Gunzip; it is recommended
to clone the project with Mercurial so they will automatically be pulled in
at the correct version, otherwise you have to download them manually:

    hg clone https://hg.sr.ht/~grauw/vgmplay-msx

Building the project is easy on all modern desktop platforms. On MacOS and
Linux, simply invoke `make` to build the binary and symbol files into the
`bin` directory:

    make

Windows users can open the `Makefile` and build by pasting the line in the `all`
target into the Windows command prompt.

To launch the build in openMSX after building, put a copy of `MSXDOS2.SYS` and
`COMMAND2.COM` and some VGM files to test with in the `bin` directory, and then
invoke the `make run` command.

Note that the [glass](http://www.grauw.nl/projects/glass/) assembler which is
embedded in the project requires [Java 8](http://java.com/getjava). To check
your Java version, invoke the `java -version` command.
