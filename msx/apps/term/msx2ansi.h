 * You MUST call it before returning to MSX-DOS, otherwise user will face a

 * start and end of buffer printing

 * the user program to determine how to send that information.

 * Callback function prototype/example:
 void CursorPositionRequestCallBack(unsigned int uiCursorPosition) __z88dk_fastcall
