/*
 * This implementation of X/Y MODEM doesn't CRC check packets during downloads
 * Mostly for three reasons:
 *
 * 1 - A few BBSs send bad CRC's not following the right CRC approach
 * 2 - Packet won't be corrupted, TCP takes care of that
 * 3 - CRC Check can be very intensive on a z80
 *
 * Thus, this implementation is meant to be used on TCP connections and do not
 * implement CRC checks.
