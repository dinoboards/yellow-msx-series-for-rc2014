MSX2 TECHNICAL HANDBOOK

Published by ASCII CORPORATION Japan in 1987

Adapted to text files by Nestor Soriano (Konami Man) in 1997

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


This disk contains the whole MSX2 Technical Handbook (except appendix 7 and
appendix 9) plus Turbo-BASIC compiler manual, all in 9 text files with the
following format:

- File format: ASCII MS(X)-DOS.

- Line width: 78 characters.

- Carriage return marks at the end of each line.

- Standard tabulation marks are used (in columns with a number multiply of 8)

Format compatibility warranty: all files have been generated with a MSX
computer.

ASCII character 92 is used as the inverse bar; therefore, viewing the files
in a MSX2+ or Turbo-R computer with the original character set will cause
some figures to appear slightly distortionated. Anyway, they will still
perfectly readable.

Files are not compressed, then you can use this disk directly with any text
editor/viewer. Problem: there is not enough room in 713K to afford all the
files. Because of this, TH-1 (the less important chapter) is compressed.

This manual was reproduced without the consent of the original authors, that
is, ASCII staff. I think that this people forgot the MSX system a long time
ago; anyway, for any complaint contact with me in <konamiman@geocities.com>.

Arigatos to Ramon Serna and Javi Lavandeira for lending to me theirs
"original" THs in march and october, respectively.
