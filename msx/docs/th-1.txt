CHAPTER 1 - MSX SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The MSX2 was designed to be fully compatible with the MSX1, but there are
many enhanced features in the MSX2. Chapter 1 introduces the enhanced
features of the MSX2, and shows block figures and standard tables. This
information is conceptual, but will be needed to understand descriptions in
volume 2 and later.


1. FROM MSX1 TO MSX2

To begin with, let us took back to the original purpose or intention of MSX
and then sum up the transition from MSX1 to MSX2.


1.1 What is MSX?

MSX was announced as a new 8-bit computer standard in the autumn of 1983. In
early days the word "compatibility" was not understood correctly and there
were misunderstandings that MSX could execute programs from other computers.
Since MSX can execute programs only for MSX, it was said that were was no
difference from the PC series (NEC) or FM series (Fujitsu) personal
computers, which could only execute programs using their format.

Several years passed before personal computers became popular. In the early
days only dedicated enthusiasts bought computers, which were difficult to
use, and, needless to say, incompatible. They were satisfied to tinker with
the computer and study it. But now computer use has expanded to include
several classes of users. In other words, the personal computer is becoming a
commodity item such as televisions or radio cassette recorders. Therefore,
"compatibility" is coming to be a problem. If each TV station needs a
different television set or if each radio cassette recorder needs a different
tape, do you suppose they would be popular? Software or programs of the
computer as a home electric product must be compatible.

The design team for MSX considered these problems. Since a computer is most
powerful when left flexible and easy to expand, a "final" standard format was
not practical. There are too many matters to define and hardware in
constantly improving. Therefore MSX started with fixing format of the most
fundamental hardware and software such as DOS and BASIC, and the hardware bus
which is the basis for expansion. Since the computer is used by itself and
does not interact with other computers, the problem is small. But formats
must be fixed if the computer is to be connected to "peripherals" and handle
or accumulate various data. Fortunately MSX had the approval of many home
appliance electric companies and an MSX format was established early. This
allowed the system to be well known so that several manufacturers could make
compatible peripherals for the MSX standard.

Some of the useful features included in the MSX system include the use of
double precision BCD for normal BASIC arithmetic and the same file format as
MS-DOS. The real capabilities of the MSX machine will come to light as it is
used across several fields.


1.2 Environment of the MSX

Over one million MSX machines had been sold by December 1985 and are used
mainly as game machines or primers by primary and junior high school
students. But MSX use has gradually spread to include such uses as
communication terminals, Japanese word processing, factory automation, and
audio visual control. For improving its capabilities, a disk system and
MSX-DOS have been prepared, and languages such as C, FORTH, and LOGO are
available. BIOS, which is the collection of input/output routines in BASIC
ROM, and BDOS, which resides in the disk interface ROM and has compatibility
with CP/M system calls have both been improved. So an excellent programming
environment is now available. Chinese Character input, light pen and mouse
input, and the RS-232C interface have been standardised, and standardisation
of other peripherals is proceeding. The keyboard and character set are
consistent with international standards, and there are minor variations to
satisfy the needs of individual countries.

Several new peripherals have been developed. Standard devices include
printers, disk drives, and mice; audio/visual devices include laser drives,
VTRs, synthesizer controllers, and video acquisition systems. Factory
Automation devices include robot controllers, room temperature controllers,
various adaptors for modem and telephone lines, and a health controller
combined with a hemadynamometer has been developed. So you can see that the
potential uses for MSX computers has really grown.

Many applications other than games are now supplied on disks and are becoming
more practical. There are now Japanese word processors capable of clause
transformation, data bases which can exchange data with higher-level systems,
and CAI and CAD systems.


1.3 Extended Contents of MSX2

MSX2 was announced in May 1985 as a system having upgraded compatibility with
MSX. Programs created under the MSX environment can be executed on MSX2
without any modifications, even at the assembly language level. Data and
programs stored on cassette tapes or disks can be used without modification.
Features added by the MSX2 system are improved screen display, higher
resolution, more colours available, and higher graphics speed. A
battery-powered clock and RAMDISK feature have also been added. In this
manual the name MSX2 refers to the computer made along the MSX2 standard and
the name MSX1 refers to the computer made along the previous MSX standard.

System configuration is shown in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 and Table 1.1 and
indicate the differences between MSX1 and MSX2. The differences are described
as follows:

* MSX-BASIC

BASIC has also been extended from version 1.0 to version 2.0 in order to
support a new VDP, backup RAM, CLOCK-IC, and so on. Compatibility with MSX1
is maintained. When using the newly extended screen mode, be careful when
specifying range, since ranges are slightly different in MSX2.

MSX2 has three types of memory, ROM, RAM, VRAM, which are described below.


ROM

Standard ROM size is 48K bytes. The MSX ROM uses only 32K bytes. The extra
16K bytes portion of the MSX2 contains routines supporting the extended
features.

The "MAIN-ROM" consists of 32K bytes and contains the BASIC interpreter, and
the "extended ROM" or "SUB-ROM" consists of 16K bytes and contains routines
for the extended features.


RAM

Standard RAM size is 64K bytes, which is large enough so that MSX-DOS can be
executed. The RAM size of MSX1 varied from 8K to 64K bytes, so in some cases
large programs could not be executed without expanding RAM. MSX2 does not
have this problem.


VRAM

A minimum of 64K bytes are required for VRAM in order to execute the added
features of the screen display. VRAM is thus four times larger than in MSX1,
which had only 16 K bytes VRAM. But many machines actually use a VRAM size of
128K bytes, which is eight times larger. Machines with 128K bytes VRAM can
display 256 colours at the same time.

MSX machines which have 64K bytes VRAM but cannot be expanded to 128K bytes
are marked "VRAM64K" on their catalogue or packaging.


* VDP

The MSX series computers use a video display processor (VDP) type LSI chip
for controlling the screen output. The VDP used for MSX1 was the TMS9918, but
the MSX2 uses the V9938 (MSX-VIDEO), which has upper and full compatibility
with the TMS9918 and can execute software for TMS9918 without any
modification.

Table 1.2 shows the VDP standard and Table 1.3 shows each screen mode. V9938
is an excellent LSI chip with digitising, superimposing, and hardware
scrolling features. Chapter 4 of this manual describes it in detail.

(*) Feature modes available from TMS9918 (however, palette feature only from
V9938).


* Battery-powered Clock-IC

Battery-powered RAM is connected to the I/O port and is used for storage of
setup information and for keeping track of the date and time. Setup
information specifies the screen colour and mode at reset. This allows the
user to set up the desired environment when the system is booted.

The CLOCK-IC works independently of the main power supply. After being set
once new time settings are no longer required.


* RAM Disk Feature

When using BASIC on MSX1 machines which had 64K bytes RAM, only 32K bytes of
RAM were used; the other 32K bytes were unused since the BASIC interpreter
occupied the address space. On MSX2 machines this unused RAM can be used as a
RAMDISK. For users who do not have a disk drive, this feature is very useful
when loading or saving BASIC programs temporarily.


2. MSX2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This section gives a simple overview of the MSX2 software and hardware
systems. To help you understand the concepts, diagrams which would be useful
when developing software, such as VRAM map, the I/O map, and the interface
standard, are found in the APPENDIX of this manual.


2.1 Hardware overview

First of all, look at the block diagram in Figure 1.3 to understand the
hardware configuration of the MSX2 as a whole.

2.1.1 Address map

* Memory map

The MSX2 has three kinds of memory: MAIN-ROM, SUB-ROM, and RAM. Each memory
resides in an independent 64K address space and is allocated as shown in
Figure 1.4 (1) (each 64K space is called a "slot", which consists of four 16K
areas called "pages"). Figures 1.3 (2) and (3) show memory usage when using
BASIC and MSX-DOS, respectively.

For each class of memory, Figure 1.5 shows the memory map of Figure 1.4
(1)(a), Figure 1.6 for Figure 1.4 (1)(b), and Figure 1.7 for Figure 1.4
(1)(c). There is also a VRAM map and I/O map whose standards are defined.
They are found in the APPENDIX.

2.1.2 Interfacing with peripherals

MSX2 interfacing with peripherals is standardised in detail.

The following is a list of standardised interfaces:

- Display interface
- Audio interface
- Cassette interface
- General-purpose input/output interface
- Printer interface

The printer interface was optional on the MSX1 but is standard on the MSX2.

The disk drive interface is still an option but may be considered part of the
standard specification because the MSX2 has 64K bytes of RAM.

For detailed information about the cartridge specifications, see the
appendix.


2.2 Software Overview

The MSX has two software environments: BASIC mode and DOS mode. BASIC mode
enables easy development and execution of MSX-BASIC program and is the mode
most often used by most users. A major reason why the use of personal
computers has grown is that BASIC is easy to use.

The DOS mode enables various languages, utilities, and applications using
MSX-DOS. Most programs in DOS can be executed on different machines. The
computers automatically compensate for any differences in hardware. This
allows the user to use accumulated software resources efficiently. MSX-DOS
uses the same disk format as MS-DOS, which is popular on 16-bit machines. You
should also note that software for CP/M, which has a great deal of
applications available for 8-bit machines, can be executed only by doing file
conversions.

A remarkable point is that BASIC and DOS use the same disk format in the MSX
machines. This enables the sharing of resources. Both are, as shown in figure
1.8, on the united software environment which has BIOS (Basic I/O System) as
a common basis. BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System), which is the basis of the
disk operation, is also constructed on this BIOS. MSX offers the same
programming environment to BASIC and DOS through common BDOS and BIOS.
