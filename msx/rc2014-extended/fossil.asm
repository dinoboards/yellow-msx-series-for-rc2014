; Extra information :
;	In register H and L, the driver reports the actually selected rate.
;	This is done in case the hardware does not support the selected
;	rate. If the driver does not support the selected rate, it selects
;	the highest possible rate below the selected.

	jp	rs_in_stat	; A=0 No data in buffer, A!=0 data in buffer
				; The F register is set according the result
	jp	rs_out_stat	; At this time every time=!0, but this is
				; reserved for future expansion of the driver
				; to sent data on interrupt. This function
				; is not needed to use, rs_in_stat is required
				; before rs_in is done.

	jp	flushbuf	; FLUSH THE RECEIVE BUFFER

	jp	fastint		; use &H0038 hook for speedup
				; H=0 Connect driver fast
				; H=1 Release fast hook

; This fastint needs some extra attention:
; The driver uses hook &HFD9A, but this is not very fast. Since this hook
; is called after some BIOS work, and after this hook, the BIOS continues
; to do some time waisting things.
; Therefore, this driver has the option to install itselve at the &H38 hook.
; This can be done if there is RAM available at &H0000-&H3FFF. This is the
; case in DOS(2).

	jp	hook38stat	; set status for 0038 hook
				; h  = 0, every interrupt is supported
				; h != 0, only RS232 interrupt (and VDP)

; This function is for use with fastint.
; When the "connect driver fast" has been issued, you can control how the
; interrupt handler of the driver behaves.
; If every interrupt is supported, there is slightly more processor time
; used after an interrupt from the RS232C interface.

	jp	chput_hook	; redirect CHPUT data to RS232
				; H=0 no redirection
				; H=1 redirect with echo
				; H=3 redirect without echo (faster)

; All print commands that would be issued using the BIOS calls, will be
; transmitted through the RS232C interface.

	jp	keyb_hook	; redirect RS232 to keyboard buffer
				; H=0 release hook, H!=0 bend hook

; With this function, you can redirect all incoming RS232C data to the
; keyboard buffer.
; This and the previous function are nice to let a terminal control your
; MSX computer.

	jp	get_info	; Gives a pointer in HL that points to a
				; driver info block. This block describes
				; the current situation about the driver.
