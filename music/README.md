### Description

With this kit, you can add the amazing advanced music generation of Yamaha's OPLL (FM synthesis) YM2413 chip to your RC2014 build.  The YM2413 is a much more capable chip compared to the stock YM2149 PSG audio.

Installed into a MSX configured RC2014 build, you can run many music applications or games to generate all kinds of music and effects.

The on-board ROM include MSX-MUSIC basic extension, allowing the full chips features to be access from MSX-BASIC. (requires the MSX-Memory board with MSX-BASIC flashed)
