Title: PPI 82C55 MSX Compatible Interface board for RC2014

Descr: Give your RC2014 the required MSX control signals.  (required for Keyboard and ROM/RAM boards)

### What is it?

This kit gives your RC2014 the required control logic for driving the MSX compatible keyboard and the MSX ROM/RAM board.

It is designed around the 82C55 PPI chip (a modern CMOS version of the original Intel 8255 chip).

### Key features
* IDC interface for full size MSX compatible keyboard.
* MSX Slot selector lines for the ROM/RAM board.
* Optional MSX M1 Wait state generator.
* Signals for Cassette Audio and Cassette Motor control*

\* Cassette board has not been designed at this stage, so is untested.

### Using keyboard on RomWBW

Although this kit is designed to work under MSX's software, it can be used in a stock RC2014 build for keyboard.

As the 82C55 is a general purpose interface chip, you could, within the contraints of the schematic, customise many of the control lines.

### What is the 'Yellow MSX Series of Boards'?

These are a series of boards that I am developing to achieve MSX compatibility for RC2014 systems.

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX/MSX2+ games!

The first board in the series is the [V9958 Video board](https://www.tindie.com/products/dinotron/v9958-msx-video-board-for-rc2014/)

The PPI board is a central component, needed for keyboard and memory mangagment.

### What's included in this kit

The full kits includes everything you need (PCB, passive components, crystals, sockets, DE9 connector for MSX compatible devices and ICs including the 82C55 chip)

### What else do I need to make this work?

* You need a working RC2014 system (cpu, RomWBW, Clock, etc - enhanced bus required).
* For audio output, an external powered speaker to plug into the standard 3.5 socket
* For controller, a MSX compatible controller


### Disclaimer

Please note that this is a kit, produced by a non-professional (me) for hackers, DIYers' and retro lovers, to tinker with.  I will do my best to answer any support questions you may have.

The YM2149 chip is obsolete and out of manufacture.  It may be old-new-stock or pre-used, and as such there is a risk it may not function correctly.  Therefore, I fully test each chip, in-circuit, prior to packaging, so you can have good confidence that the chip you receive will perform as required.
