## Title

MSX Cartridge Slot Extension for RC2014 Bus

## Brief Description

A extension module for RC2014 backplanes to support MSX Cartridges



### Description

Tired of slow load times for your games?  Miss the days of flicking the power button and having your game instantly running?  Well perhaps this kit is for you.  Pair the Slot Extension with a MSX configured RC2014 build, and you can load cartridge based games and software with the simple of a flick of the power button.  

This module attaches to the right most slot on a RC2014 backplane and gives your RC2014 two 50pin MSX card connectors slots.  It include required decoding logic for addressing the slots as per the MSX standard.

It includes optional support for an on-board DC converter to step up the 5V from the RC2014 backplane to +12/-12 voltages. 

Once installed and operating on a MSX configured RC2014, you can boot up original 1980's MSX cartridges or install new modern release cartridges from places such as https://www.msxcartridgeshop.com/

Or perhaps you can select the optional MSX Cartridge 16K/32K ROM board and flash your own (or downloaded) game and enjoy the era of instant gaming.


### Key features

* 2 MSX 50pin compatible cartridge slots 
* Indicator LEDs when a cartridge is inserted and powered.
* Optional DC converter to supply +12/-12V*
* Optional 16K/32K blank rom for you to flash**

Please note that mounting stand-offs are not supplied.

\* Most cartridges do not need or use the 12V lines.  A 5 way screw power terminal is provided if you wish supply the +12V/-12V from an external source.  
\*\* The supplied ROM is a blank SST39SF040 Flash chip.  You will need an external programmer to flash this chip. 

### What is the 'Yellow MSX Series of Boards'?

These are a series of boards developed to achieve MSX compatibility for [RC2014](https://rc2014.co.uk/) systems.

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX games!

More details of the development of the Yellow MSX series of modules can be found on my [hackaday project](https://hackaday.io/project/175574-msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014)
