      BINARY FILE LOADER  v1.02 By GDX

	           MANUAL
--------------------------------------------

 BINLOAD.COM can load and run under MSX-DOS 1/2 binary format files that
 normally start under BASIC with the BLOAD instruction.


Minimum requirements:

- MSX 64kB
- MSX-DOS 1


Use:

 From a command line of MSX-DOS enter the command as the following form.

 BINLDR Filename.Ext

 File name extension become ".BIN" by default.
 When the file name is omitted, help is displayed.


Options:

 While loading the file, you can press the following keys to change the
 environment.

[JIKOU] (MSX Turbo R)

- Since most programs are designed to run on MSX 1 or 2, the Z80 mode is
  automatically selected when running on MSX Turbo R. [JIKOU] key (on the
  right side of the space bar) selects the R800 mode with ROM. In this mode,
  some programs may run too fast.

[SHIFT]

- This key uninstalls the drives from the system and stops their motor.
  This is useful if you have a hard drive and you intend to play long time.

  Note: More programs work by pressing [CTRL] until the beep during the MSX
        initialization (even if you press [SHIFT] during loading). It can
        be useful for software that need floppy drive.

[SELECT]

- This key prevents the disc motor from shunt down.
