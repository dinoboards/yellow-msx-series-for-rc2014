## V9958 Video Module Designed for RC2014

Hackaday Project: [msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014](https://hackaday.io/project/175574-msx-compatible-boards-for-rc2014)

There have been a few variations of the Video Module.

## V99x8 MSX RGB Module for RC2014 (V3.8)

This kit supports a RGBs output via a standard 15-pin DSUB/VGA connector. A standard VGA cable can be used to plug directly into a compatible device (converter or native 15kHz supported monitor).

It can accommodate a V9938 or the slightly more advanced chip the V9958.

This kit is very similar to version V3.3, but with improved support for the V9938 and the processing of the CSYNC signal improves image stability.

## V9958 MSX Video Advanced Module for RC2014 (V1.9)

This kit, in addition to producing an RGBs output signal, also provides composite and s-video output.

Due to space restrictions, the RGBs output is via a mini-din connector, thus necessitating a custom cable be made if RGB output is desired.
