V9958 MSX Video board for RC2014

## Brief Description

Give your RC2014 the advanced graphics of the late 80s.  Based around the V9958 chip, used in the MSX2+ line of computers.

## Full Description

### What is it?

A complete kit to give your RC2014 the advanced graphic capabilities of the mid to late 80s. It's based on the V9958 Video Display Processor (VDP) which powered
the MSX2+ line of 8 bit Z80 computers.

This V9958 chip, was produced by Yamaha in the late 80s and was an update to the their V9938 chip, which was itself, a successor to TI's TMS9918 VDP.  The V9938/V9958 addressed many of the shortcomings of the original TMS9918.


### Some of the V9958 key features include:

* Hardware acceleration (line and dot commands, horizontal scrolling registers, and others)
* Support for up to 19268 colours
* 13 Screen Modes
* Resolutions up to 512 x 212

This is the first board produced within the "Yellow MSX Series".

### What is the 'Yellow MSX Series of Boards'?

These are a series of boards developed to achieve MSX+ compatibility.

The idea is that you can build each board one at a time, test it and play with it under RomWBW - and then once you have the set - load up some MSX/MSX2+ games!

The V9958 board is the first in that series.

### Key features of this board

* Compatible with RC2014 (enhanced bus required)
* 128K of RAM
* RGB, Composite and S-Video output
* Can be built for PAL or NTSC

### What's included in this kit

The full kits includes everything you need (PCB, passive components, crystals, sockets, connectors and ICs including V9958 and 4x41464C RAM chips)

(The components for both the PAL and NTSC versions are included).

### What else do I need to make this work?

* You need a working RC2014 system (cpu, RomWBW, Clock, etc).
* A solution to display Composite, S-VIDEO or RGBS signals.  For a modern monitor you will almost certainly need a converter of some kind.
* For RGB output (recommended for best quality), you may need to make a cable to connect to your preferred display.

### Disclaimer

Please note that this is a kit, produced by a non-professional (me) for hackers, DIYers' and retro lovers, to tinker with.  I will do my best to answer any support questions you may have.

I have conducted the following tests for this board:

- RGB PAL and NTSC connected to a [OSSC](https://www.retrorgb.com/ossc.html) (to a HDMI monitor).
- NTSC Composite and S-VIDEO output connected to a cheap ebay VGA converter (colours and quality output ok but not brilliant).
